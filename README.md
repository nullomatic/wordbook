# TODO

- integrate WordNet data, maybe also EuroWordNet
- highlight first search result / go to word page on Enter
- remove huge files from repo and host elsewhere
- add word page with meanings, definitions, and synonyms
- intersect wiktionary dataset with smaller dictionary
- add translator
- add "word of the day" widget
- add fake ads

if the word already exists in English, just add 'an' tag.
else, create a new entry. try to collect accurate senses and link them to the right synsets.

combine moot.json + wordbook.json => entries

make Anglish examples out of English
