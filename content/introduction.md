# What is Anglish?

Anglish is a form of English that strives to use words rooted in the language's native heritage, avoiding those borrowed from foreign tongues. It represents a movement of linguistic purism applied to English, seeking to return the language to its more traditional form by minimizing the influence of external languages.

The idea of creating a "new English" [has been around for quite some time](/wiki/history-of-anglish). One of the earliest advocates was William Barnes, a 19th-century Dorset poet who argued that using more English-based words would make the language easier to understand for everyday speakers. Even before Barnes, the monk Orm, writing in 1180, tried to craft his homilies using language that a common English congregation would understand, largely avoiding Latin and French words. His work could be considered an early model of Anglish, though the term itself did not exist.

The purpose of Anglish is to create a version of English with far fewer borrowed words, reclaiming the essence of what makes the language distinctly English. Over time, English has undergone fundamental changes due to the influence of foreign languages, so much so that the English spoken today bears little resemblance to its original form. To say that modern English is the same language once spoken by the English people is akin to saying that modern French is still Latin. English has become an international language, blending influences from many cultures. The Anglish project, therefore, seeks to restore the Englishness of the language and return its ownership to the English people.

## The Goal of the Anglish Project

The goal of the Anglish project varies depending on the individual, but at its heart, it’s about exploring and experimenting with the English language. For some, this exploration is driven by aesthetics; for those with English heritage, it can fulfill cultural needs; and for others, it’s simply a fascinating hobby or creative outlet. Language shapes much of our daily lives, and the ability to play with and reshape it according to our desires is important. For many, speaking or writing in a purely English form is rewarding in itself, offering a fresh way to engage with the language.

At a deeper level, Anglish also serves as a recognition and celebration of the English elements still present in modern English. Despite the language absorbing thousands of borrowed words over the centuries, a core of true English remains—the essential everyday words without which sentences would be incomplete. By peeling back the layers of borrowed terms, Anglish allows us to appreciate and highlight this core and its role in shaping the language we use today.
