# The History of Anglish

The history of Anglish spans over eight centuries, evolving in various forms along the way. Although the term "Anglish" (or New-English) was only coined in 1966, the core idea of purifying English by favoring native words has appeared in the works of writers as far back as the 1100s. The status and condition of English at different points in history have shaped the perspectives of those advocating for its purer form.

The history of Anglish can be divided into two key periods: ancient and modern. In the ancient period, English was considered a low-status language, heavily absorbing words from French, Latin, and Greek. By the modern period, English had already been deeply influenced by these borrowings, but it had risen to the status of a high-prestige language in its own right.

## The Anglo-Saxon Period

Before the Norman Conquest, the West Saxon dialect of English, shaped by the Athelwoldian reforms, held the position of the "official language" of the English state. It was widely used in civil affairs and had a flourishing and growing body of literature. Latin, as in much of Europe, was the language of the church and religion, and although some Latin words made their way into English, these borrowings were relatively limited and mostly confined to religious terms. During the reign of Edward the Confessor, the presence of French in the English court grew, leading to a small number of French words entering the language as additions rather than replacements.

Following the Norman Conquest, the English upper class was largely replaced by French-speaking rulers. Initially, English continued to be used in many civil settings, but over time, French became the dominant language of the state. Those involved in high-status cultural, social, and civil spheres were expected to speak French. For the English people aiming to participate in these circles, learning French became necessary. However, those lower on the social ladder often lacked the means to learn French, leaving them excluded from national cultural and social activities. Over time, many French words trickled down from the elite to common folk, who adopted them in an effort to align with the status associated with the French-speaking upper class.

## Vernacular Writers

The earliest example of this type of work is from around 1180, known as the _Ormulum._ Named after its author, Orm, a monk from Lincolnshire, it is a collection of homilies meant to accompany Bible readings in church. The work was crafted for an English-speaking congregation, and though it contains many Old Norse words—reflecting the Norse influence on English—it uses very few Old French words, despite the growing presence of French in other contemporary writings like the _Peterborough Chronicle._

A few decades later, around 1215, Layamon, a priest from Worcestershire, produced a translation of Wace's _Roman de Brut._ He deliberately used an archaic form of English, resisting the linguistic changes occurring at the time. The work mainly draws on Anglo-Saxon vocabulary, with only a small number of French words. _Layamon's Brut_ became a popular work, widely copied and read, though later copyists frequently modified the language, adding more French words to the text.

The final significant work from this period is the _Ayenbite of Inwit_ (literally, "The Remorse of Conscience"), written in 1340 by a Kentish monk named Michael. It is a translation of the French _Somme le Roi,_ a treatise on Christian morality. Michael made a conscious effort to translate difficult French and Latin terms into English, even coining new words when necessary. However, the text still contains a large number of borrowed words, many of which had been part of the language for over a century, reflecting the deepening influence of French and Latin on English.

## Early Opinions

Roberto of Gloucester, writing in the mid to late 13th century and reflecting on earlier times, remarked:

> The Norman could not speak anything then except their own speech, and they spoke French as they had done at home, and had their children taught it, too, so that important men in this country who come from their stock all keep to that same speech that they derived from them; because, unless a man knows French, he is thought little of. But humble men keep to English and their own speech still. I reckon there are no countries in the whole world that do not keep to their own speech, except England only. (Little has changed.)

In 1295, King Edward I, while issuing writs to summon Parliament, warned of a plan by the King of France to invade England and extinguish the English language—calling it "a truly detestable plan which may God avert.

Around 1300, the anonymous Cursor Mundi, a religious poem in northern Middle English, contained the lines:

> This same book is translated, in accordance with the dignity of Holy Church, into the English tongue to be read, for love of the English people, the English people of England, for the common people to understand. I have normally read French verses everywhere here; it is mostly done for the Frenchman — what is there for him who knows no French? As for the nation of England, it is an Englishman who is usually there. It ought to be necessary to speak mostly the speech that one can best get on with. Seldom has the English tongue by any chance been praised in France; if we give everyone their own language, it seems to me we are doing them no injury. I am speaking to the English layman...

In 1323, Henry Lambard, a cleric, stood before a court facing charges of theft. When asked how he wished to clear himself, Lambard responded in English, claiming it was proper for him, an English-born man, to speak his native tongue. Despite being asked if he knew Latin or French, Lambard refused to speak any language but English. His refusal led to his commitment to another court to suffer Peine forte et dure, a form of severe punishment for those who would not plead.

## Modern Opinions

Paul Jennings, who first introduced the term "Anglish" in the British satirical magazine _Punch_, admitted that the idea was initially meant as a joke. His three articles titled 1066 and All Saxon, published in June 1966 to mark the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, took a lighthearted approach to the concept. However, leaving the satire aside, George Orwell suggested there were valid reasons for purging non-English words from the language to create a "New-English," advocating for the use of as many Germanic-origin words as possible.
