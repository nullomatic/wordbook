## Differing Opinions on How "English" the Vocabulary of Anglish Should Be

There are varied opinions on how strictly Anglish should adhere to its goal of a purely English vocabulary, free of foreign, primarily Latin and Greek, influences. Some believe that Anglish should simply make the best use of the native English words that remain, avoiding borrowed terms where feasible but accepting them when necessary. Others advocate for the complete removal of borrowed words and are willing to invent entirely new English-based words when no native alternative exists. These two views represent the broadest differences within the Anglish project, though there are many perspectives in between, depending on each writer's personal approach to the language.

## The Presence of Borrowed Words in English

The best way to find out the origin of a word is to look it up in a dictionary. Most reputable desktop dictionaries provide short etymologies for many entries, offering insights into where a word originated and how it has been used over time. Online dictionaries such as the Oxford English Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, Dictionary.com, and Wiktionary also contain this information. For a deeper dive, etymological dictionaries, like the Online Etymology Dictionary, are excellent resources.

However, while these sources can tell you when and from where a word entered English, they donâ€™t always clarify whether the word should be considered "borrowed." For example, words like "cup" and "mill" are ancient borrowings from Latin, but no one questions their status as English words. On the other hand, recent borrowings like "thaumaturgy" and "intelligentsia" are clearly foreign in origin. Determining which words are truly English and which are borrowed is subjective and varies among Anglish proponents. Some suggest that any word borrowed from French, Latin, or Greek in the last 800 years should be considered borrowed, while others believe that if a borrowed word fills a genuine need in the language, it should be retained.

English is famous for borrowing extensively from other languages over the last thousand years. While the core of English is Germanic, only about 25% of today's English words come from Germanic roots, including words from Norse, Dutch, German, and English itself. Latin and French each account for about 29% of the vocabulary, with another 6% coming from Greek, and the remaining 10% from various other languages, personal names, or unknown origins. Despite this, the core everyday vocabulary remains largely English, making the Anglish project feasible.

## Replacing Words with their Anglish Equivalent

There are several ways to replace words that have been removed from English. Sometimes, an existing English synonym can be used; for example, "quotidian" can be replaced by "everyday," and "illegal" by "unlawful" without losing meaning. When no ready replacement exists, a new word may be needed. This can involve reviving old or obscure English words, creating new words based on English morphemes (calquing), or coining entirely new words (neologisms). Each method has its place in building the Anglish lexicon and is used depending on the context and needs of the word.
